TRF:
	Put trf executable in your environment or point to it with command XYZ
	Lots of stuff about how this analysis is actually done
bed:
	How do you build the bed file to make it work?


Cleaning GenomeTree:
  Need to move the genome_tree builders into bed/vcf_anno
  And I need to generalize the GenomeTree so I can build either anno into 
  And that will require a refactor back of bench, need to preserve the GenomeTree functions
  Ideally we would have a system of
  
  ```
    anno = GenomeTree("file.[bed|vcf]")
  
    for entry_to_annotate in vcf:
        hits = anno.hits(entry)
        for x in hits:
            add_fields_to(entry_to_annotate)
  ```
  
  And of course hits could be filtered.
    And add_fields_to could then be generalized and reused in multiple places
