v3.0

* Working on speed improvements

* Added edlib as the default when calculating pctseq_sim, keeping Levenstein as an option
* Added —keep common to collapse which allows one to choose to keep the allele with the highest MAC
* Collapse --hap wasn't working correctly. The assumptions about the calls
  being phased wasn't being properly used (don't collapse 1|1) and
  the NumCollapsed was being populated before the single-best match was chosen.
  The latter is a reporting problem, but the former had an effect on the
  results with ~3% of collapsed calls being mis-collapsed
* truvari.annos.grm has min_size argument
* truv2df’s vcf_to_df now allows a specific sample to be specified  and better Number=A handling
* reworked truv2df into vcf2df - Default is vcf conversion with options to run on a truvari directory
* NeighId added to numneigh annotations which works like bedtools cluster
* af_calc now makes MAC/AC
* Added 'partial' to remap anno
* removed `truvari stats` as vcf2df is better
* Ubiquitous single version
* Code and repository cleaning
* Github actions for automated pylint, testing, and releases to pypi
