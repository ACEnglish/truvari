I can use chunker, don't need file_zipper

I can use Matcher, all those params are the same
# consider pulling out the shared arguments so I 
# just send from each prog the argparser and get
# the stuff added. Easy enough.

I don't need collapentry anymore. I'll just take 
the Base for one of a set and the rest can go to
collapse.


For each chunk, all against all. 
Note that I only need the top diagonal since it'll be symmetrical
So I i can reuse chunker, but I don't reuse chunk_compare

----- these collapse without chain

4 is by itself

Well - we also have this picking strategy.

So, imagine we take the FIRST. So we sort them by position.
Then, we take the first one, and collapse anything it matches with
 -- lets ignore chain for now.
Then we look at the next one which we haven't already used,
pick it and go


Say we want most common - sort by most common.
Then we take the most common one. And collapse anything it matches with.
Same as before.

We're going to need extra matching checks on stuff for --hap.
That'll just be setting state=False for anything that's on the same haplotype

For chain, once we get a match (from the sorted, we have to then go to that call and
Find everyone its matching
And find everyone they're matching
and recursive


A big part of this refactor is getting INV working.
I think I just need to get comparisons to work
	So sequence - just get the alt
	Size - I need to just get the length  (or read the ALT or whatever)
	I left the SVLEN alone in my stuff, so those need to be reset... dangit
