Structural variants occupy a 'span' in the genome of many bases. 
Historically, SV detection such as aCGH has given rough estimates of start and end boundaries of SVs.
This lead to lenient approaches to SV comparison that accomidate the lack of breakpoint precision.

As SV detection has improved the predicted affected sequence and precision of predicted breakpoints,
few tools have been developed to accomodate the improved signal and lenient SV comparison has continued
to be performed.

We developed Truvari as a tool to calculate multiple metrics for SV comparison. These metrics were carefully
implemented using best practices and can be simultaneously weighted amongst one another. By allowing full 
paramaterization of these metrics, Truvari can compare SVs from all resolutions.

Some of the matching metrics are described below.

So, in the case of aCGH, `--refdist 5000 --pctsim 0 --pctsize 0 --pctovl .8`
And for most modern SV tools reported events `--refdist 500 --pctsim 0.7 --pctsize 0.7`


Comparing Structural Variants
=============================

 █ = Deletion ^ = Insertion

--refdist REFDIST (500)
  Max reference location distance

    ACTGATCATGAT
     |--████--|    
          █████      
  
  Calls are within reference distance of 2

--pctsize PCTSIZE (0.7)
  Min pct allele size similarity

    ACTGATCATGA
      █████     -> 5bp
        ████    -> 4bp

  variants have 0.8 size similarity


--pctovl PCTOVL (0.0)
  Min pct reciprocal overlap

    ACTGATCATGA
      █████      [2,7)
        ████     [4,8)

  variants have 0.6 reciprocial overlap


--pctsim PCTSIM (0.7)
  Min percent allele sequence similarity

    A-CTG-ACTG
     ^   ^       haplotypes
     |   └ACTG -> CTGACTGA
     └CTGA     -> CTGACTGA

  haplotypes have 100% sequence similarity
