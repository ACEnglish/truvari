By default, Truvari will only allow a one-to-one match between a base call and comparison call. The motivation for this is be more strict when trying identify FPs in comparison calls. For example, if you have a redundant variant reported in the comparison calls, only the single best representation will become a TP, where the rest will be FPs.

However, Truvari's current method with this default behavior does create a race-condition (see [Issue #7](https://github.com/spiralgenetics/truvari/issues/7)). The race happens because Truvari compares per BASE event and unites to its best COMP event. Looser parameters could allow an upstream BASE call match a COMP call with a lower 'score' than what another downstream BASE neighbor would - therefore matching variants that aren't necessarily the best global match. This may allow many combinations of BASE/COMP calls floating between TP and FN/FP.

With the `--multimatch` parameter, we can get around this by allowing all of the redundant matches of base and comparison calls. This should have the effect of increasing the reported recall and sensitivity. The final counts of TP-base and TP-call in the `summary.txt` could also have different numbers. Furthermore, when inspecting TPs, some of the comparison calls may not be the most accurate representation of the allele; we have attempted to ensure that strict Truvari parameters produce a subset of the looser parameters over the same base/comparison call sets.
