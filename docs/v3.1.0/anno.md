# truvari anno gcpct

This will add an INFO tag `GCPCT` to each element in a VCF of the GC percent of the call's sequence.

For deletions, this is the GC percent of the reference range of the call. For insertions, the ALT sequence is analyzed.
```
usage: gcpct [-h] [-i INPUT] [-o OUTPUT] -r REFERENCE

Annotates GC content of SVs

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -i INPUT, --input INPUT
                        VCF to annotate (stdin)
  -o OUTPUT, --output OUTPUT

  -r REFERENCE, --reference REFERENCE
                        Reference fasta
```

# truvari anno gtcnt
This will add an INFO tag `GTCNT` to each element in a VCF with the count of genotypes found across all samples. The value is a list of Counts of genotypes for the allele across all samples (UNK, REF, HET, HOM). This is most useful for pVCFs.

```
usage: gtcnt [-h] [-i INPUT] [-o OUTPUT]

Annotates GTCounts of alleles

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit

  -o OUTPUT, --output OUTPUT
                        Output filename (stdout)
```

# truvari anno trf
Adds a tandem-repeat annotation to each entry in your VCF.

This requires the [trf executable](http://tandem.bu.edu/trf/trf.download.html), which can either be in your environment `$PATH` or can be directly pointed to through the command line parameters. This also uses SimpleRepeat tracks over the reference genome (e.g. [`resources/`](https://github.com/spiralgenetics/truvari/tree/develop/resources)).

First, every SV is parsed and intersected with the SimpleRepeat track. If the SV hits a SimpleRepeat region, the SV will be annotated. Furthermore, we build the haplotype sequence of the alternate allele and the SimpleRepeat region and feed that sequence into tandem repeat finder. We then intersect the repeats TRF found with the repeats found in the SimpleRepeat track intersection. If the same repeat is found in both, we annotate with the TRF information as well as reporting the difference in the number of copies in alternate allele's haplotype sequence via TRFDiff.

INFO fields added
* TRF - Entry hits a simple repeat region
* TRFDiff - Simple repeat copy difference
* TRFperiod - Period size of the repeat
* TRFcopies - Number of copies aligned with the consensus pattern.
* TRFscore - TRF Alignment score
* TRFentropy - TRF Entropy measure
* TRFrepeat - TRF Repeat found on entry

# truvari anno grm

For every SV, we create a kmer over the the upstream and downstream reference and alternate breakpoints. 
We then remap that kmer to the reference genome and report alignment information.
This does not alter the VCF traditional annotations, but instead will create a pandas 
DataFrame and save it to a joblib object.

There are four queries made per-SV. For both reference (r), alternate (a) we create upstream (up) and downstream (dn) kmers.
So the columns are all prefixed with one of "rup_", "rdn_", "aup_", "adn_".

In the alignment information per-query, there are three 'hit' counts:
- nhits : number of query hits
- dir_hits : direct strand hit count
- com_hits : compliment strand hit count

The rest of the alignment information is reported by average (avg), maximum (max), and minimum (min)

The suffixes are:
- q : mapping quality score of the hits
- ed : edit distance of the hits
- mat : number of matches
- mis : number of mismatches

For example, "aup_avg_q", is the alternate's upstream breakend kmer's average mapping quality score.

# truvari anno svinfo

Uses `truvari.entry_size` and  `truvari.entry_variant_type` on entries >= `args.minsize` to add 'SVLEN' and â€˜SVTYPEâ€™ annotations to a VCFâ€™s INFO.

How SVLEN is determined:
- Starts by trying to use INFO/SVLEN
- If SVLEN is unavailable and ALT field is an SV (e.g. \<INS\>, \<DEL\>, etc), use abs(vcf.start - vcf.end). The INFO/END tag needs to be available, especially for INS.
- Otherwise, return the size difference of the sequence resolved call using abs(len(vcf.REF) - len(str(vcf.ALT[0])))

How SVTYPE is determined:
- Starts by trying to use INFO/SVTYPE
- If SVTYPE is unavailable, infer if entry is a insertion or deletion by looking at the REF/ALT sequence size differences
- If REF/ALT sequences are not available, try to parse the \<INS\>, \<DEL\>, etc from the ALT column.
- Otherwise, assume 'UNK'
